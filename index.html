      <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Skeletal muscles generate force and enable physical activity. It is due to muscle contraction which requires energy. Prolonged or repetitive use of a muscle causes decline of energy supply to meet the consumption and therefore muscles get fatigued. The mechanism of fatigue is multifactorial and not fully understood, however is believed to involve the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), muscle units, and individual muscle fibers1. Muscle fatigue can be measured by the strength of hand grip. Low grip strength indicates tiredness or muscle weakness resulting in smaller force. The decreased force can be identified by a decrease in the frequency of the electromyogram (EMG) signal. It is significant to study grip strength and muscle fatigue because it is a predictor of endurance, strength, and overall health of an individual.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Understanding grip strength has various uses. Physical therapists and orthopedics can use it to evaluate the extent of an injury, progress of recovery, and to diagnose  neuromuscular problems such as stroke, herniated disks in the neck, carpal tunnel syndrome, and elbow tendonitis. Grip strength also relates to performance of athletes in many sports, such as tennis, golf, baseball, football, gymnastics, and rock climbing. <br>
        Skeletal muscle is composed of bundles of individual muscle fibers, slow fibers, fast  fibers, and intermediate fibers, which respond to stimuli (e.g., nerve impulse) by contracting with an all or none response. Once a muscle has contracted, relaxation must  occur before it can contract again. Fast fibers contract quickly but for a relatively short duration. Slow fibers respond less rapidly, but are capable of a more sustained contraction. As a result of contraction, a muscle is more likely to get tired when it is used for an extended period of time or repeatedly, also known as muscle fatigue. <br>
        It is expected that as we hold (grip) an object continuously or repetitively for a longer time, the force exerted by hand will decrease over time because the muscle gets fatigued. However, if a signal to grip harder is given, voluntary muscle contraction will cause an increase in the force. Voluntary contraction is a result of communication between the brain and individual muscle fibers of the musculoskeletal system, where a thought is transformed into electrical impulses which travel down motor neurons (in the spine and peripheral nerves) to the neuromuscular  junctions that form a motor unit. The strength of contraction of a whole muscle depends on how many individual fibers are activated,  and can be correlated with electrical activity measured over the muscle with an EMG sensor. The experiment measures and compares grip strength in right and left hands and also correlates it with gender, handedness, height, and repetitive and continuous grip3.

        <h3>Procedures</h3>
        <p>The procedure involves three parts: Grip Strength Comparison, Grip Strength and Muscle Fatigue, and EMG and Muscle Fatigue. <br>
        <br><u>Grip Strength Comparison</u></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Part I</p>
        The hand dynamometer was connected to the vernier computer interface. The readings for the hand dynamometer were zeroed. The hand dynamometer was held along the sides, in an upright position without putting any force on the pads of the dynamometer. The subject sat with his or her back straight and feet flat on the floor, holding the dynamometer in the right hand with elbow at a 90° angle, arm unsupported, and eyes closed. After collecting 2s of baseline data, the subject was instructed to grip the sensor with full strength for the next 8s. The same steps were repeated with the left hand and the maximum and mean force exerted by each hand during a portion of the data collection period was recorded. The experiment was repeated for each person in the class and the average was calculated in table 1,2, and 3.
        <br><p style="text-align: center;">Part II</p>
        <p> The experiment was further modified to examine pinch strength. Instead of holding the dynamometer with one hand, it was pinched with the thumb and forefinger of the dominant hand, and held  for 5s, and then switched to successive fingers every 5s. The data was collected for 20s, and the mean force applied during each pinch was determined. The obtained data were recorded in table 4.</p>
        <p><u>Grip Strength and Muscle Fatigue</u></p>
        <p>The hand dynamometer was connected to the vernier computer interface. The readings for the hand dynamometer were zeroed. The hand dynamometer was held along the sides, in an upright position without putting any force on the pads of the dynamometer. The subject sat with his or her back straight and feet flat on the floor, holding the dynamometer in the right hand with elbow at a 90° angle, arm unsupported, and eyes closed. The subject was instructed to grip the sensor with full strength for the next 90s and then at 90s, he/she is encouraged to grip even harder. The maximum force during the intervals of 0-10s, 20-30s, 40-50s, 60-70s, and 80-90s was recorded in table 5(A). The same steps were repeated with the left hand and results were recorded in table 5(B). 
        </p>
        <br>
        <u>EMG and Muscle Fatigue</u>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Part III</p>
        <p>The hand dynamometer and the EKG sensor to the vernier computer interface were connected. Three electrode tabs were attached to one of the arms. Green and red tabs were placed on the ventral forearm, 5cm and 10cm from the medial epicondyle along an imaginary line connecting the epicondyle and the middle finger and the black on the upper forearm. The subject sat with his/her back straight and feet flat on the floor, elbow at a 90° angle, arm unsupported, and eyes closed. The subject was then instructed to grip the sensor with full strength and data collection was started. The subject was encouraged to exert maximum effort throughout the data-collection period until 80s, at which he/she was encouraged to grip even harder. The force and maximum and minimum EMG potential were collected for 100s for intervals of 0-20s, 40-60s, and 80-100s in table 6. The same steps were repeated with eyes open and the data was recorded in table 7. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Part IV</p>
        <p>The experiment was further modified to examine repetitive grip strength. Instead of continuously holding the dynamometer, the subject was instructed to rapidly grip and relax his/her grip on the sensor (approximately twice  per second), exerting maximum effort throughout the duration of data collection. After the 80s, the subject was encouraged to grip even harder for the next 20s and data was recorded in table 8.

        <h3>Data and Results</h3>
        <img id="result1" src="images/result1.png" alt="Image_1">
        <p>Mean continuous grip strength of dominant hand of 15 people was measured to be 118.8N with an standard deviation of 64.6N whereas of non-dominant hand of 14 people was 124.4N with an standard deviation of 51.8N (Table 1). The mean grip strength of 4 male’s dominant hand was 118.8N and female’s was 75.8N (Table 2). Mean grip strength was measured to be 121.1N, 162.1N, 291.7N, and 483.4N over height intervals of 155-163 cm, 165-173 cm,  175-183 cm, and 185-200 cm respectively (Table 3). The mean force was found to be 48.2N, 64.7N, 35.9N, and 19.2N for index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger of dominant hand respectively (Table 4).
        </p>
        <img src="images/result2.png" alt="Image2">
        <p>The maximum force generated by continuous grip was measured to be 166.2N, 128.8N, 100.3N, 88.3N, and 87.3N over the time intervals of 0-10s, 20-30s, 40-50s, 60-70s, 80-90s respectively (Table 5A). The maximum grip strength for repetitive grip was 172.7N, 146.0N, 118.3N, 96.0N, and 84.1N over the time intervals of 0-10s, 20-30s, 40-50s, 60-70s, 80-90s respectively (Table 5B). The rate of decrease of grip strength for both continuous and repetitive grip was 0.75N/s (Table 5C).

        <h3>Discussions</h3>
          <p>This experiment measures, compare, and contrast the  average grip and pinch strength of the class and find its relation to Grip strength is used to evaluate the extent of an injury, the progress of recovery, to diagnose neuromuscular problems like a stroke, herniated disc in the neck, carpal tunnel syndrome, and elbow tendinitis. Sometimes, pinch strength is also used to measure loss of fine motor units in the thumb, fingers, and forearm. These measurements are significant for athletes because it relates to performance in many sports such as tennis, golf, baseball, football, gymnastics, and rock climbing. 
          <br><br>The dominant hand possesses a 10% greater grip strength than the nondominant hand4. However, the data in table 1 shows that the average grip strength of the class in the dominant hand (118.8N) is weaker than that of the non-dominant hand, (124.4N). This might be due to biased gripping because the dominant hand should be stronger than non-dominant since they are used the most often and could build up more strength and dexterity. Similarly, the average grip strength of males was measured to be 118.8N and females 75.8N (Table 2). The males have stronger grip than females because men have more motor units which give them extra strength compared to women. Generally speaking, as the height increases the grip strength also increases (Table 3). Table 4 depicts that the index and middle finger were the stronger while the ring and pinky finger were weaker, with the middle finger being the strongest and the pinky finger being the weakest of them all. The possible reasons may be because index and middle fingers are used frequently which build more strength in them and also radial muscle controls them which is bigger than ulnar muscle that controls the ring and pinky fingers.
          <br><br>The muscle fibers had reached their maximum potential of 166.2N for continuous grip (Table 5A) and  172.7N for repetitive grip (Table 5B). The potentials for both rapidly decreased because the hand used its full strength at the start and got fatigued quickly. At this point, the fast fibers were switched on which contracted very strongly and quickly, but for relatively short duration getting fatigued ultimately. 
        Also, the decreasing slope of the graph (Figure 1A and 1B) indicates that the muscle is getting tired and weak because the grip force is becoming smaller over time. Moreover, the force was less strong in the third 10 seconds (Table 5A and 5B) which means intermediate fibers were activated during that moment. The weakest strength in the final seconds indicates that slow fibers were switched on during that time because it showed slow and more sustained contraction, and slow response to fatigue. In short, the force was less stronger in the third 10 seconds versus the first because the muscle needed to rest again in order to contract. 
          <br><br>All motor neurons, EMG, muscle performance, and work have a direct relationship. An increase in one factor increases the rest. EMG should be less when grip strength is low and higher as grip increases. The amplitude of EMG and force of contraction increases when more motor units are switched on or frequency of firing of the motor units is increased. The force is strongest i.e. 190.3N and 172.0N (Table 6 and Table 7 respectively) in the first 20 seconds because when applying the continuous group more muscle fibers fire in the first 20 seconds and then it takes time for the muscle to relax to contract again. When a signal to grip harder at 80s is given, the subject contracts the relaxed muscle again which results in stronger grip strength than the first 20 seconds (Table 6 and7). However, compared to repetitive grip strength (Table 8), the difference in muscle fatigue rates is because through the re-grip, there is a small window for the muscles to relax and eventually fight again, so the muscle produces very small strength of 56.8N (as can be seen in table 8). The change in EMG seems to increase greatly in the 80s because grip strength is highest at that moment (Table 6,7, and 8). 
          <br><br>In conclusion, the force exerted by hand will decrease over time as the length of time of grip, continuous or repetitive, increases because the muscle gets fatigued. However, if a signal to grip harder is given, voluntary muscle contraction will cause an increase in the force. </p>
